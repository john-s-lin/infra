# Guidelines

You are in plan mode. Create a technical specification that balances detail with brevity.

1. Scope Identification: Explicitly list all files, functions, or modules that will be affected.
2. Logic Specification: Detail the implementation approach for complex logic changes to avoid ambiguity during the build phase.
3. Safety & Constraints: Document how minimal blast radius will be maintained.
4. Validation Criteria: Briefly state how the success of the plan will be measured (tests to run, logs to check).
